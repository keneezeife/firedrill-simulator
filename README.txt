SOFTWARE: VIRTUAL DRILL FIRE DRILL  SIMULATOR

DESCRIPTION: This program simulates a fire emergency situation in Virtual Reality. It prompts the player to put out fires with a fire extinguisher and escape the building. 

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM(USER MANUAL)
1. Set up Oculus as directed by the Oculus software. Go to add headset.
2. Open the folder "Term Project Fire Drill Simulation" and open the "Computer Programming Project" executable file.
3. Immerse yourself in the VR experience and follow the game instructions.


PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES FACED
1. The teleporatation functionality
2. The fire extingusihsing 
3. Problems with Physics and Colliders


WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY
1. To make the drill more educative, different types pf fire extomgishers could have been used in the simulation. This would have helped the user identify different types of fires(eg. chemical fires and electrical fires) and the type of fire extimguisger to use.eg. powder, water and carbon dioxide.

2. Introduction of a timed setting that forces the user to complete the course in a specified amount of time, to enforce the emergency of the situation.

3. Widening the environment of the project and adding new environments.


FUTURE WORK
1. Incorporating different types of fire extinguishers to be used in the simulation. Hence, the user will learn about the different types of fires (e.g. chemical fires, electrical fires) and the proper way to put them out.
2. Widening the environment of the project and adding new environments.
3. Introduction of a timed setting that forces the user to complete the course in a specified amount of time, to enforce the emergency of the situation.
